# Weatherwise Outage Postmortem

## Issue Summary
- **Duration of Outage**: 09:00 AM to 11:00 AM UTC, May 9, 2024
- **Impact**: The Weatherwise app experienced a significant slowdown affecting 70% of users. Users reported difficulty loading weather forecasts and receiving real-time updates.
- **Root Cause**: A misconfiguration in the Nginx reverse proxy settings led to an excessive number of requests being forwarded to the backend servers, causing them to become overloaded.

## Timeline
- **09:00 AM UTC**: The issue was first detected through monitoring alerts indicating a spike in server response times.
- **09:15 AM UTC**: The issue was escalated to the backend team after initial investigations by the frontend team did not reveal the root cause.
- **09:30 AM UTC**: The backend team identified the misconfiguration in the Nginx settings and began investigating potential fixes.
- **10:00 AM UTC**: The backend team implemented a temporary fix by adjusting the Nginx configuration to better distribute requests.
- **10:30 AM UTC**: The temporary fix was confirmed to have alleviated the issue, and the system returned to normal operation.
- **11:00 AM UTC**: The incident was fully resolved, and a permanent fix was implemented to prevent future occurrences.

## Root Cause and Resolution
- **Root Cause**: The Nginx reverse proxy was misconfigured, causing an imbalance in the distribution of requests to the backend servers. This led to the servers becoming overloaded, resulting in slow response times and difficulties for users accessing the app.
- **Resolution**: A temporary fix was implemented by adjusting the Nginx configuration to better distribute requests. A permanent solution involved updating the Nginx configuration to include rate limiting and load balancing features to prevent similar issues in the future.

## Corrective and Preventative Measures
- **Improvements**: Implement robust monitoring and alerting for Nginx to detect and alert on configuration issues early. Enhance the backend servers' capacity to handle spikes in traffic.
- **Tasks**:
 - Review and update Nginx configuration to include rate limiting and load balancing features.
 - Implement monitoring for Nginx to detect configuration issues.
 - Enhance backend server capacity to handle traffic spikes.
 - Conduct regular audits of Nginx and backend server configurations to ensure optimal performance.

This postmortem outlines the steps taken to address the outage, the root cause identified, and the measures implemented to prevent a recurrence. By following these corrective and preventative measures, Weatherwise aims to ensure a more reliable and efficient service for its users.
